# ROS_Projet
Navigation

Just roslaunch the challenge123.launch file, it will start gazebo and all nodes, rviz is not started to save space.

Because the startup time is different, there may be errors that the parameters are not yet defined. It doesn't matter, the robot can pass after all nodes are started

In order to facilitate observation, we have an image window display, the red point is the midpoint of the robot (the midpoint of the image), the blue points are the midpoints of the two lines, and the green point is the target point.

We connect the different challenges with red lines, so the robot can go through all the challenges automatically (even go on 2nd, 3rd laps...)
